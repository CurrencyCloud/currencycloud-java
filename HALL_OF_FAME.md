### **Moving money shouldnâ€™t be hard**
Here at [Currencycloud][ccy] we are totally committed to remove the complexity and red tape of international payments so that our customers can focus on delivering a great experience for their customers.

Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community of people volunteering their time, knowledge and skills to help us further develop our SDKs to levels of quality and usability that otherwise would be very difficult to achieve completely on our own.

Many people have helped us along the way and we are sincerely grateful to all of them but we would like to single out, and in a small way honour, the following individuals for their meaningful contributions (listed in alphabetical order):

|Name|Link/e-mail|

|Chris Campo|cccampo.progs@gmail.com|
